Log films with comprehensive details including mood tracking, which captures the emotional experience beyond just a rating. The interface is designed to be quick and intuitive while still capturing meaningful data.

- **Serious Analysis** - Direction (20%), Screenplay (20%), Cinematography (15%), etc.
- **Entertainment Value** - For blockbusters and popcorn movies
- **Specific Genres** - Horror-specific criteria, documentary standards, etc.

The weighted score automatically calculates based on category weights, giving you a nuanced rating system.

### Gentle Recognition

- Viewing consistency (weekend streaks)
- Cultural diversity (countries explored)
- Discovery (new directors)
- Variety (genres and decades)

Achievements appear naturally as you watch films, without pressure or FOMO.
